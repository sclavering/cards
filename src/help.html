<div id="acesup">
<h1>Aces Up</h1>

<p>The aim is to get all the card onto the foundation (the pile on the right), except for the Aces,
which should each be in a separate pile.</p>

<p>Any card on the top of one of the four main piles can be moved to the foundation if the top card
of one of the other piles, or the card immediately below it, is of the same suit and higher rank than
it.  Aces are high.  For example, the five of hearts (if at the top of a pile) could be moved to the
foundation if one of the other piles had the six of hearts (or any higher heart) on top, or if it was
itself immediately on top of such a heart.</p>

<p>Clicking on the stock deals one card to each of the four main piles.</p>
</div>


<div id="blackwidow">
<h1>Black Widow</h1>

<p>A variant of <a href="#spider">Spider</a> in which any descending run of cards may be moved, not
just those where all the cards are of the same suit.  A run from King down to Ace must still be all
of the same suit for it to be moved to the foundation.</p>
</div>


<div id="canfield">
<h1>Canfield</h1>

<p>A single deck of cards is used.  The aim is to move them all to the foundations (the four piles
in the top middle), which are built up in suit, a single card at a time, starting with the number
of the card which is in the left-most foundation when the game is first dealt, and wrapping round
from King to Ace.</p>

<p>The main piles (the four below the foundation) are built down (wrapping round from Ace to King)
in alternating colours (e.g. the 4S might go on the 5H).  Runs of cards may be moved together, and
any card (or run of cards) can be used to fill a space.</p>

<p>The <dfn>reserve</dfn> (the pile on the right) initially holds 13 cards.  These can be moved onto
the four main piles or onto the foundations whenever is convenient.  The reserve cannot be built on.</p>

<p>Clicking on the stock (the pile in the top left) deals one card to the waste pile (the one below
it).  Clicking it when it's empty returns all the cards from the waste to the stock (which you can do
as many times as you want).  The top card from the waste pile can be moved to the main piles or the
foundations.  Neither the stock nor the waste may be built on.</p>
</div>


<div id="demon">
<h1>Demon</h1>

<p>Like <a href="#canfield">Canfield</a>, except that all the cards in the reserve are visible
(so you can plan further ahead).</p>
</div>


<div id="doublesol">
<h1>Double Solitaire</h1>

<p>Like <a href="#klondike">Klondike</a>, but with more piles, two decks, and the foundations are
built A, A, 2, 2, 3, 3, ..., Q, Q, K, K (in suit).</p>

<p>The top two cards of each foundation are visible, so that you can see which number belongs there
next.</p>
</div>


<div id="doubleklondike">
<h1>Double Klondike</h1>

<p>Like <a href="#klondike">Klondike</a>, but with two decks of cards, ten piles, and eight
foundations (two for each suit).</p>
</div>


<div id="fan">
<h1>Fan</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used; the aim is to move them all to the foundations (the 4 piles at the
top), which are built from Ace up to King in suit.</p>

<p>The other piles are built down in suit, and only Kings may be used to fill spaces.  Only single
cards (not runs) may be moved.</p>
</div>


<div id="fortythieves">
<h1>Forty Thieves</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used; the aim is to move all cards to the foundations (the 8 piles at the
top), which are built from Ace up to King, in suit.  (There will be two for each suit.)</p>

<p>The ten main piles (the ones at the bottom) are built down in suit (i.e. a
10 of clubs can only have a 9 of clubs placed on it), spaces being filled with
any card.  Only a single card may be moved at once (not a run); though for
convenience the program will let you drag more than one around, but will check
that there are enough spaces that you could have moved the group using a
sequence of moves of single cards.</p>

<p>Cards from the stock can be dealt one at a time to the waste, the contents
of which are all visible, though only the top one can be moved (to either the
foundations or the main piles).  You may only go through the stock once.</p>
</div>


<div id="freecell">
<h1>FreeCell</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations (the 4 piles in the
top-right corner), which are built upwards in suit, one card at a time.</p>

<p>The four piles in the top-left are <dfn>cells</dfn> – they can each hold any single card, which
can be removed at any time.  The 8 piles across the bottom are built down, alternating colours, and
any card may be used to fill a space.  Technically, only one card may be moved at once, so to move a
run from one pile to another you need to put most of the cards in free cells or spaces (empty piles)
before moving the lowest card in the run, and then move the other cards back from the cells/spaces.
Since this is rather tedious, the game will allow you to a drag a run of cards from one pile to
another provided there are enough cells and spaces that you <em>could</em> have used a series of
single-card moves.</p>
</div>


<div id="golf">
<h1>Golf</h1>

<p>Either one or two decks of cards are used.  The aim is to move all the cards from the piles on
the bottom row onto the foundation (the right-hand pile on the top row).</p>

<p>The top card of each of the piles on the bottom row is available for play.  You can only move the
cards onto the foundation, and only if it is one greater than or one less than the top card on the
foundation (e.g. an 8 could be moved onto either a 7 or a 9, of any suit).  Kings may go on Aces and
vice versa.</p>

<p>When no cards from the bottom row can be moved you can click on the stock to deal a new card to
the foundation.</p>
</div>


<div id="divorce">
<h1>Grounds for Divorce</h1>

<p>Two decks of card are used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations, which are built from King to Ace in suit.</p>

<p>Cards are built down on the piles from King to Ace, and a King may be placed on an Ace. Runs of cards of the same suit may be moved together.  Any card or run of cards may be moved to a space.</p>

<p>Clicking on the stock will deal one card to each of the piles.<p>
</div>


<div id="gypsy">
<h1>Gypsy</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used. The aim is to move all cards to the foundations, which are built from Ace to King in suit.</p>

<p>The tableau piles are built down by alternate color. An empty pile can be filled with any card or with a sequence of cards.</p>

<p>If no more moves are possible, click on the stock pile and a card will be added to every tableau pile.  Cards on the foundations can also be moved back to the tableau piles.</p>
</div>


<div id="klondike">
<h1>Klondike</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations (the four piles in
the top right corner), which are built Ace to King in suit.</p>

<p>The seven piles across the bottom are built down in alternating colours, and runs of cards may
be moved together between them.  Only a King (or a run starting with a King) may go in a space.</p>

<p>Cards from the stock (the pile in the top left) are dealt one at a time to the waste pile
immediately to the right of the stock.  The top card of the waste pile is always available for play
to either the foundations or the seven piles across the bottom.  Clicking on the stock pile when it
is empty will transfer all the cards from the waste pile back to the stock, so you can go through
them again.</p>
</div>


<div id="klondike3">
<h1>Draw-Three Klondike</h1>

<p>Like <a href="#klondike">Klondike</a>, except that cards are dealt from the stock in batches of
three.</p>
</div>


<div id="maze">
<h1>Maze</h1>

<p>One deck of cards less the Kings is used.  The grid of positons should be considered as a loop:
the end of one row connects to the beginning of the row below, and the end of the bottom row
connects to the beginning of the first (note that the final row has one less position than the
others). The aim is to arrange the cards in runs for each suit from
Ace to Queen from left to right.  The four spaces can occur anywhere between runs.</p>

<p>A card may be moved to a space if any of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it is of the same suit and one greater than the card in the pile to the left
  <li>it is of the same suit and one less than the cards in the pile to the right
  <li>it is an Ace and there is a Queen (of any suit) in the next pile left
  <li>it is a Queen and there is an Ace in the next pile right
</ul>
</div>


<div id="mod3">
<h1>Mod 3</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations, of which there are
24 (the first three rows of piles).  Foundations in the first row are built 2, 5, 8, J (in suit, one
card at a time); in the second row they are built 3, 6, 9, Q; and in the third row 4, 7, 10, K.</p>

<p>The eight piles along the bottom may not be built on except that empty piles can be filled with
a single card from either the foundations or the other piles.</p>
</div>


<div id="montana">
<h1>Montana</h1>

<p>A single deck of cards, less the Aces, is used.  The aim is to have each suit laid out 2, 3, 4, 
5 ... K across a separate row, with an empty pile after the King.</p>

<p>You can move any 2 to a space at the start of any row.  Other cards may only be moved into a
space immediately to the right of the next card down in the same suit (e.g. a 6H can only be moved
into a space to the right of a 5H).</p>

<p>The redeal button (on the tool bar) will shuffle any cards that are not part of a run that starts
with a 2 in the first column (i.e. any cards not in a place they should be to win the game).</p>

<p>An unlimited number of redeals is allowed (unlike previous versions of Cards, which only allowed two).</p>
</div>


<div id="penguin">
<h1>Penguin</h1>

<p>A single deck of cards is used; the aim is to get them all onto the foundations (the 4 piles on the right).</p>

<p>The foundations are built up in suit from Ace to King, one card at a time.  Three of them start with an Ace on them.</p>

<p>The remaining Ace starts at the bottom of the left-most pile.  The piles are built down in suit.  Multiple cards can be moved together if they are a run of the same suit.  Only a King may be put in a space.</p>

<p>The cells across the top can each hold any single card.</p>

<p>Note: some versions of Penguin deal a random card to the bottom of the left-most pile (rather than always an Ace), and then start the foundations with the other cards of that number (wrapping from King to Ace if needed).  This version is a simplification of that.</p>
</div>


<div id="pileon">
<h1>Pile On</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to get all cards of a given number into the same pile
(e.g. all the 8s in one pile).  Cards (either single cards, or groups all of the same number) can be
moved either in to a space, or on to other cards of the same number, but no pile may ever hold more
than four cards.</p>
</div>


<div id="pyramid">
<h1>Pyramid</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to remove all the cards from the pyramid to the foundation
(the pile on the right) by forming pairs of cards that add up to 13 (suits are irrelevant).  Aces
have a value of 1; Jacks a value of 11; Queens a value of 12; and Kings have a value of 13, so can
be moved to the foundation on their own rather than as part of a pair.  The cards in the stock can
be used to form pairs with those in the Pyramid as needed, but don't have to be removed.</p>
</div>


<div id="regiment">
<h1>Regiment</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used.  The aim is to move them all to the foundations (the eight piles on
the top row), the first four of which are built from Ace up to King, and the others King down to
Ace.  There must be one foundation of each type for each suit.</p>

<p>The piles on the third row are <dfn>reserves</dfn>.  They can't be built on, but the top card is
available for play.  The piles in the second and fourth rows can be built on up or down (or both at
once) within suit.  Empty piles must be filled using the top card of the nearest reserve pile that
isn't empty (you can choose which to use if there are two equally-distant reserves, and you don't
have to fill empty piles immediately).</p>
</div>


<div id="russiansol">
<h1>Russian Solitaire</h1>

<p>One deck is used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations, which are built up in suit from Ace to King.</p>

<p>The tableau piles are built down in suit.  The top cards of each pile are available for play, with any group of face up cards being moved as a unit regardless of sequence as long as the bottom card of the cards being moved is one less and of the same suit of the top card on the pile that it is moved to.</p>

<p>Spaces may be filled with any card or group of cards.  (Note: this is more permissive than most versions of this game, which require a King to fill a space.)</p>
</div>


<div id="sanibel">
<h1>Sanibel</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations, which are built up in suit from Ace to King.</p>

<p>The tableau piles are built down in alternating colors, with any group of face-up cards being moved as a unit regardless of sequence, as long as the bottom card of the cards being used is one lower and of a different color to the top card of the pile it is being placed on.</p>

<p>Spaces in the tableau may be filled by any face-up group of cards.  (This is more permissive than most versions of Sanibel, which require a King or a group with a King at the bottom.)</p>

<p>Clicking on the stock will turn one card over onto the waste pile, which can then be moved to the tableau.</p>
</div>


<div id="simon">
<h1>Simple Simon</h1>

<p>Fifty-two cards organised into four Ace-King runs are used.  You can choose whether to use one,
two or four suits (fewer suits makes for an easier game).  The aim is to move all cards to the
foundation (the right-most pile).  As in Spider, you must organise the cards into complete runs from
King down to Ace, in a single suit, before moving the entire suit to the foundation.</p>

<p>The other piles can be built down without regard to suit, with any card filling an space.  Runs
of cards of the same suit may be moved together.</p>
</div>


<div id="towers">
<h1>Seahaven Towers</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations in the top-right, which are built up in suit from Ace to King.</p>

<p>The four cells in the top-left may each hold any single card.  The ten bottom piles piles are built down in suit.  Spaces may be filled by a King.</p>

<p>The rules only permit moving one card at once.  If you try to move multiple cards, this will be permitted so long as there are enough free cells that it would be possible to move them all one card at a time.</p>
</div>


<div id="spider">
<h1>Spider</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundation (the space on the right), in thirteen-card same-suit King–Ace groups.</p>

<p>Cards are built down on the ten columns from King to Ace (in any suit).  Groups of sequential cards of the same suit and may be moved as a unit.</p>

<p>Clicking on the stock will deal one card to each of the piles, but can only be done if there are no empty piles.<p>

<p>A few variants of Spider using fewer suits are available.  These make the game easier to win.</p>
</div>


<div id="tripeaks">
<h1>TriPeaks</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to move all the cards from the three interlocking pyramids
to the waste pile (the pile in the lower middle-right).</p>

<p>Cards from the stock (the pile in the lower middle-left) are dealt permanently and individually
to the waste pile.  Cards from the pyramids can be moved to the waste pile only if the value of the
card being moved is either one higher or one lower than the waste pile card; Kings can be placed on
Aces and vice versa.</p>
</div>


<div id="unionsquare">
<h1>Union Square</h1>

<p>Two decks of cards are used; the aim is to move them all to the foundations
(the 4 piles on the right).</p>

<p>The foundations (one for each suit) are built from Ace up to King, and then
from King down to Ace (i.e. A, 2, 3, ..., J, Q, K, K, Q, J, 10, ...., 3, 2, A).
Any cards from the second King onward are offset slightly to the right so that
it is immediately obvious whether the foundation is being built up or down at
a given time.</p>

<p>The main 16 piles are each built either up or down in a given suit (but not
both up and down at the same time).  Both the top and bottom card of each pile
are visible so that you can see which direction the pile is being built in.</p>

<p>The cards from the stock (pile in the top left) can be dealt one at a time
to the waste (the pile below the stock), from whence they can be moved to the
main piles or the foundations.  You may only go through the stock once.</p>
</div>


<div id="wasp">
<h1>Wasp</h1>

<p>One deck of cards is used.  The aim is to move all cards to the foundations (the initially-empty
pile on the right).  Cards can only be moved to the foundation in runs (King to Ace) of the same
suit.</p>

<p>Any face-up card from the lower piles is available for moving, and the cards on top of it move
with it.  A card may only be moved into a space, or onto the next higher card in the same suit (e.g.
the 4H can be moved onto the 5H).</p>

<p>The stock (the pile on the left) initially holds three face-down cards.  Clicking on the stock
will deal one of these cards to each of the first three piles.</p>
</div>


<div id="whitehead">
<h1>Whitehead</h1>

<p>Like <a href="#klondike">Klondike</a>, except that you may only go through
the stock once, the main piles are built down in the <em>same colour</em>,
and runs may only be moved if all the cards are of the same suit.</p>
</div>


<div id="yukon">
<h1>Yukon</h1>

<p>One decks of cards is used; the aim is to move them all to the foundations
(the 4 piles on the right), which are built up in suit, one card at a time.</p>

<p>Any face-up card (or run of face-up cards) can be moved, and can be put in
either an empty pile, or onto a card one-greater and of the opposite colour.</p>
</div>
